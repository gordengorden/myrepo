## Initial Setup
## Running with Docker

This project provides a Docker setup for the ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) API service. The service is built using Python and PyTorch and exposes port 8001.

### Build and Run

Use Docker Compose from root to build and run the service:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

To stop the service:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will build the `asr-api` service from the `./asr` directory using the provided Dockerfile and start the API on port 8001.

### Service Details
- **Service name:** asr-api
- **Base image:** python:3.9
- **Exposed port:** 8001 (host: 8001 â†’ container: 8001)
- **Dependencies:** Installed from `./requirements.txt`

### Configuration
- No environment variables are required by default.
- No volumes or external dependencies are needed for this service.

### API Endpoints
